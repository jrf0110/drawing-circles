      <h1>What Drawing Circles Taught Me</h1>
      
      <p>Despite having been a developer for 10 years, I've yet to seriously get into computer graphics. I've often fantasized about making novel video games and beautiful computer generated art, but never got around to it. Let's change that.</p>
      
      <p><a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> is the graphics platform I've been playing with. It's free, open source, and available on Linux, OS/X, and Windows. It compiles down to Java, so anywhere the JVM is installed, Processing can run (probably).</p>
      
      <h2>Boilerplate setup</h2>
      
      <p>Here's what a barebones processing sketch looks like:</p>

<pre><code class="java">void setup(){
  // Setup the size of your canvas to 500px by 100px
  size( 500, 100 );
}

// This function is called for each animation frame
void draw(){
  // Redraw the entire canvas with black each frame
  background(0);
}</code></pre>
      
      <p>Unless otherwise required, I'm going to omit the `setup()` definition to keep things shorter.</p>
      
      <h2>What to draw first?</h2>
      
      <p>My first idea was to simply get an ellipse drawn on the screen. Let's draw a 5px wide circle at the coordindates (250, 50), or rather, at the center of the canvas -</p>
      
<pre><code class="java">void draw(){
  // Make the canvas solid black
  background(0);

  // Prepare x,y coordinates
  float x = 250;
  float y = 50;

  float width = 5;
  float height = 5;

  // Draw circle 
  ellipse( x, y, width, height );
}</code></pre>
  
      <iframe
        src="/circle-1.html"
        height="100"
        frameborder="0"
        class="iframe-example"></iframe>
      
      <p>Yay!</p>
      
      <p>And if that last act didn't bore you, let's make the circle smoothly move back and forth -</p>
      
<pre><code class="java">float PERIOD = 100;
float AMPLITUDE = 100;

void draw(){
  background(0);

  float i = (float) frameCount;
  
  // Starting point
  float x = 250;
  
  // Change PERIOD and AMPLITUDE with the sliders
  x += sin( i / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;

  ellipse( x, 50, 5, 5 );
}</pre></code>
      <iframe
        src="/circle-2.html"
        height="160"
        frameborder="0"
        class="iframe-example"></iframe>
      
      <p>We're using a periodic function called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine">Sine</a> to smoothly transform the value <code>250</code>. For each <code>x</code> value, the returned values for sin continulously vary between -1 and 1.</p>

      <p>This is perhaps best explained by the <code>sin(x)</code> graph itself:</p>

      <iframe
        src="/sin.html"
        height="160"
        frameborder="0"
        class="iframe-example"></iframe>

      Notice how the y value varies between 0 and 2 times its amplitude. We use this to create the movement in the previous example.

      <h2>Let's make an ellipse go into orbit</h2>

      <p>We've seen how to make an object move smoothly back and forth, now what about orbit? For that, we'll use what's called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation" target="_blank">parametric equation</a>. Basically, you use a single function to define the value of x and a single function to define the value of y.</p>

      <p>For instance, the following is the parametric equation for a circle:</p>

      $$x: sin(t)$$
      $$y: cos(t)$$

      <p>What does that mean, though? It means for any given moment in time, let's draw a dot at \(x = sin(t)\) and \(y = cos(t)\) where t is time. What does that look like?</p>

      <iframe
        src="/circle-3.html"
        height="380"
        frameborder="0"
        class="iframe-example"></iframe>

<pre><code class="java">void draw(){
  background(0);

  float i = (float) frameCount;
  
  // Starting point
  float x = width / 2;
  float y = height / 2;
  
  // Change PERIOD and AMPLITUDE with the sliders
  x += sin( i / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;
  y += cos( i / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;

  outputVariables( x, y );

  ellipse( x, y, 5, 5 );
}</code></pre>

      <p>Pretty nifty, huh? Let's add another, circle and make them sort of, spin in the same orbit, but directly across from each other:</p>

      <iframe
        src="/circle-4.html"
        height="380"
        frameborder="0"
        class="iframe-example"></iframe>

<pre><code class="java">void draw(){
  background(0);

  float i = (float) frameCount;
  
  // Starting point
  float x1 = width / 2;
  float y1 = height / 2;
  float x2 = x1;
  float y2 = y1;

  float x2y2offset = PI * PERIOD;
  
  // Change PERIOD and AMPLITUDE with the sliders
  x1 += sin( i / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;
  y1 += cos( i / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;
  
  x2 += sin( ( i + x2y2offset ) / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;
  y2 += cos( ( i + x2y2offset  ) / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;

  ellipse( x1, y1, 5, 5 );
  ellipse( x2, y2, 5, 5 );
}</code></pre>

      <p>Oh man, this is getting unwieldy. Surely we can keep our code <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, and clean some of this up.</p>

      <h3>Cleaning up with Classes</h3>

      <p>To cleanup our code, we're going to use what's called <a href="https://processing.org/reference/class.html">a class.</a> For those of you unfamiliar with Classes, they are a programming construct to define the structure and interactions of data. You can think of them of ways to encapsulate concepts.</p>

      <p>Sorry, that said a lot without actually saying anything. Think of them as prototypes that you can copy from. Some folks will say this is a bad and conflated analogy, but to those detractors I say, "hey, I don't give a damn."</p>

      <p>So, you think, I want to prototype, or model, a wide variety of cars. How would I reprsent them? We need to reprent things like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Make</li>
        <li>Model</li>
        <li>Color</li>
        <li>Velocity</li>
        <li>Position</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A class would allow us to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="java">
  car1 = new Car( "Toyota", "Prius" );
  car2 = new Car( "Honda", "Civic" );

  // car1.make is Toyota
  // while car2.make is Honda
</code></pre>

      <p>We create objects based on pre-defined properties (such as Make/Model). Here's what our car Class might look like</p>

<pre><code class="java">
class Car {
  string make;
  string model;

  // By default, all cars are white
  string color = "white";

  // What's our position in space?
  float x = 0;
  float y = 0;

  // When cars are created, set the make and model
  Car( string _make, string _model ){
    make = _make;
    model = _model;
  }

  void drive( float _x, float _y ){
    x = _x;
    y = _y;
  }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>Let's see what we can do:</p>

<pre><code class="java">
  car1 = new Car( "Toyota", "Prius" );
  // Currently, car1.x is 0 and car1.y is 0

  // Drive to (100, 50) at 10mph
  car1.drive( 100, 50, 10 );

  // Now, car1.x = 100 and car1.y = 50
</code></pre>

      <h3>How can we utilize classes?</h3>

      <p>This may seem all a bit <em>abstruse</em>, but classes will help us modularize our code into understandable chumks. That will then allow us to do some really neato stuff.</p>

      <p>Naming is pretty important in programming, but I couldn't think of a good name. I'm just going to call our helper class "XObject" because that sounded generic and cool enough for me.</p>

      <strong>xobject.pde</strong>

<pre><code class="java">
class XObject {
  float x = 0;
  float y = 0;
  float size = 5;
  
  float xOrigin = 0;
  float yOrigin = 0;
  
  float xOffset = 0;
  float yOffset = 0;
  
  float period = 20;
  float amplitude = 50;
  
  XObject( float _x, float _y ){
    xOrigin = _x;
    yOrigin = _y;
  }
  
  void update( float frame ){
    x = xOrigin;
    y = yOrigin;
    
    x += sin( ( frame + xOffset ) / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;
    y += cos( ( frame + yOffset ) / PERIOD ) * AMPLITUDE;

    ellipse( x, y, size, size );
  }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>And here's our new main sketch file:</p>

<pre><code class="java">float PERIOD = 20;
float AMPLITUDE = 50;

// Wait to instantiate our objects because we need to
// know the dimensions of our canvas
XObject o1;
XObject o2;

void setup() {
  size( 500, 300 );

  // Instantiate our objects, setting our origins at the center
  o1 = new XObject( width / 2, height / 2 );
  o2 = new XObject( o1.xOrigin, o1.yOrigin );
}

void draw() {
  background(0);

  float i = (float) frameCount;

  // In our example, we update the period and amplitue on
  // the fly with sliders. We need to re-update the values
  o1.period     = PERIOD;
  o2.period     = PERIOD;
  o1.amplitude  = AMPLITUDE;
  o2.amplitude  = AMPLITUDE;
  
  // Object2 has an offset on the unit circle
  // The circles diameter is equal 2*PI*period
  // So, halfway around the circle is just PI*period
  o2.xOffset = PI * o2.period;
  o2.yOffset = PI * o2.period;

  // Call the objects drawing logic with the current frame
  o1.update( i );
  o2.update( i );
}
</code></pre>
  
      <iframe
        src="/circle-5.html"
        height="380"
        frameborder="0"
        class="iframe-example"></iframe>

      <p>That's better.</p>

      <p>Play around with the sliders in the previous example. Notice how amplitude now corresponds to the length of the line that joins these two points. We're finally getting into something whose usefulness is at a higher of level than the immediately solveable problem.</p>

      <h3>Why do classes matter?</h3>

      <p>Now we can have fun with loops :)</p>

      <iframe
        src="/circle-6.html"
        height="380"
        frameborder="0"
        class="iframe-example"></iframe>

      <p class="tip">Experiment with moving the AMPLITUDE toggle back and forth very fast. Change the PERIOD to see how that affects the pattern.</p>

      <p>Here's the code for the above example:</p>

<pre><code class="java">float PERIOD = 20;
float AMPLITUDE = 50;

// Number of XObjects we're going to draw
int NUM_OBJECTS = 30;

// This is an array of XObjects
XObject[] objects = new XObject[ NUM_OBJECTS ];

void setup() {
  size( 500, 300 );
  initObjects();
}

void initObjects(){
  for ( int i = 0; i < NUM_OBJECTS; i++ ){
    objects[i] = new XObject( width / 2, height / 2 ); 
  }
}

void draw() {
  background(0);

  float frame = (float) frameCount;

  for ( int i = 0; i < NUM_OBJECTS; i++ ){
    objects[i].updateUserVars( PERIOD, AMPLITUDE );
    
    // Evenly place objects along the circle
    // Remember that ( 2 * PI * PERIOD ) is the diameter
    // diameter / NUM_OBJECTS is the length of an arc between
    // each object. Multiply it by its index in the array to
    // its position on the circle
    objects[i].xOffset = ( ( 2 * PI * PERIOD ) / NUM_OBJECTS ) * i;
    objects[i].yOffset = objects[i].xOffset;
    
    objects[i].update( frame );
  }
}</code></pre>
